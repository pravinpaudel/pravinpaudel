## Hey, I’m Pravin 👋

I specialize in turning messy, ambiguous ideas into **clear, executable systems**.

As a Computer Science student, I build scalable software by emphasizing structure, clean abstractions, and feedback-driven iteration - so systems improve with use instead of collapsing under it.

I’m drawn to problems where structure matters - designing software that remains understandable, maintainable, and useful as it grows. My projects emphasize system clarity, iteration based on real usage, and long-term reliability over one-off features.

## 🧠 Engineering Mindset
- Systems over scripts
- Clarity beats cleverness
- Scale reveals design flaws

I care deeply about clean abstractions, thoughtful tradeoffs, and writing software that other engineers can confidently build on.
